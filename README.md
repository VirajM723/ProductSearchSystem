# Instructions to run



You should have Node.js, MongoDB and Elasticseach installed. After all being installed, start the MongoDB server,

then the Elasticsearch server. 



From the root folder run 'npm install' to install the dependencies. 



Finally, to run the node server, just run 'npm start' or 'node path/to/bin/www', and your app will be up and running!





The versions tested by me are: MongoDB v8.2.1, Elasticsearch v9.2.0, Node.js v14.21.3
